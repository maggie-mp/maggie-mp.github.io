			<p>Z Energy’s Outdoor Payment Terminals are a self-servicing device mounted directly at a fuel pump to allow customers to pay quickly without having to go inside. They’re built for efficacy for customers who want to pump, pay then leave, and reduces pressure on forecourt staff to keep up with demand. Z deploys over 1,600+ payment terminals over two weeks. External stakeholder Invecno, typically give Z Energy Prompt Sets, which include identification.</p>

			<h2>Problem</h2>

			<p>Z Energy had set up an OPT Design System hosted on Figma. Despite it being established, the Design System was difficult to navigate, missing key artifacts for designers and developers, underutilising Figma atomic components capabilities, not audited for accessibility, and lacking centralising documentation for all stakeholders.</p>

			<p>This made experience designers risk having inconsistent designs for hand-off, developers not having key artefacts to integrated slowing their development, and under-developed user flows with unclear interaction points the user flows and no documentation of error paths, for quality assurance testers. </p>

					Accessibility Statement: <br><br>
					This website aims to follow WCAG 2.2 AA. I used Venngage and Colour Contrast Checker websites to make sure it met the contrast standard. Usability testing was done after the development of the website with a variety of people, including one tester with disabilities. Sadly, no assistive technology was used during the testing phase. This website was built with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The limitations of this website include: not all images include alternative text, sections are not in plain language, and this website may break on mobile devices. <br>If you have any accessibility issues with this website, please contact me via email: magsmcperry@gmail.com. <br>Thank you!</p>
