		<h1>Research Project:</h1>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="column paragraphs">
				<p>The idea of the Internet and spreading of information has exploded since the Internet was first conceived. Despite information being more accessible due to technological advances, it has become harder to discern what information is fact or fiction and whether website designers have the best interest of the user. <br><br>
 
				Positive web design can include inclusivity, promoting positive societal change, and fostering communities. It is human-centred, inclusive, and makes it more usable for everyone. <br><br>
		 
				Negative web design often includes spreading misinformation, contractual obligations, and compromising users’ data for the company's benefit. Interfaces are beneficial to the designer rather than the users by tapping into users’ emotional involvement (Nodder, 2011). All of this could be accumulated under an area called ‘dark patterns’ - patterns that scam users and do not benefit them.</p>

		<!--THE D-LIST-->

		<div class="row">
			<div class="column report">
				<img src="images/report_img/dlist_1.png" alt="Image of the D-List Website">
			</div>

			<div class="column report">
				<img src="images/report_img/dlist_2.png" alt="Image of the D-List Website with high contrast mode activated">
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="column paragraphs">
				<p>The first positive website is the D-List. It’s an online magazine highlighting the disability culture written for disabled people. The articles on the page feature clear headings and paragraph text. The navigation bar underlines and highlights when selected to indicate hyperlinks to different pages. A feature is the high contrast mode for changing the colour scheme. This changes the content from the brand colours to black and white, making it easier for people with low vision. The website itself is also responsive when enlarged. Having these accessibility elements within the website means current event articles are accessible to everyone, creating safe spaces for knowledge sharing across different communities. This is a design that does not obscure information but enhances it for the user.</p>

		<!-- Whaikaha -->

			<div class="column report">
				<img src="images/report_img/govt_2.png" alt="Image of the alternative document readings on the Whaikaha website">
			</div>
		</div>


		<div class="row">
			<div class="column paragraphs">
				<p>The second example is the Whaikaha - Ministry of Disabled People website. Featuring a cream background with light grey accents and plum-purple text, it is a clean, simple, and well-thought-out colour palette. The colours are a good contrast for those with colour blindness or low vision. The logo features a video of the New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) interpretation of their Ministry Department. Most documents attached to the website pages have alternative document readings for those with intellectual disabilities, and drop-down menus are clearly marked across the navigation bar. This is a highly informational website without the need for unsolicited advertising.</p>

			</div>
		</div>


		<div class="row">
			<div class="column paragraphs">
				<p>The final positive website is Chelsea Sugar, featuring many recipes. Most recipe websites include affiliate links and hidden advertisements before getting to the recipe content. This can make navigation tedious for the user and deter them from using the website. Chelsea Sugar’s website features clean colours of its brand with easy-to-follow steps. It includes useful information like ratings and clear pictures of the content. The main navigation is unique with its pictorial categories of recipes. The website is clutter-free making it easy to navigate, and doesn’t ask users for personal details through hidden cookies.</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="column paragraphs">
				<p>Amazon Prime, a streaming service,  is an example of a negative website design. Cancelling a subscription is difficult as Amazon psychologically manipulates users into doubting their decision by having a lengthy six-page process. It forces users to ‘take a look back at your journey with Prime’. Emotional association is designed to influence the user’s behaviour. It asks users to consider loss aversion of cancelling and promote interacting with something more enjoyable like listening to music or online shopping. Buttons throughout the process are very similar in layout and functionality, potentially confusing users with which button to press.</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="column paragraphs">
				<p>Temu is a website that sells cheap products. A banner features the fabricated ‘collaboration’ between Temu and NZ Post about how they will ‘work together’ to create efficiency of deliveries. It is a clever deception teaming with a reputable postage service that is personalised towards our locality. This is using fake social proof tactics. Temu using buzzwords like ‘speedy’, ‘convenient’, and ‘courteous service’ creates a false sense of security to the user that they will get the best service through Temu without outlining how.</p>
