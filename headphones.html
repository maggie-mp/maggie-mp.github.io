			<h1>Can you Hear Me?</h1> <br>
			<br><br> 

			<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 12px;">My creative output showcases accessibility challenges and is displayed by my broken headphones packaging. Its title is: “Can You Hear Me?”, featuring the tongue-in-cheek slogan: Enjoy these broken, muffled headphones. Catered to your listening experience!<br><br>The foundation behind my creative output was Critical Design. Originating from research, it asks viewers to question and be critical of the products/services they are interacting with. This could be through creative activism and challenging dominant ideologies (Malpass, 2017). Linking this to accessibility, I wanted to challenge the charity model still prevalent in societal discourse, specifically with the Deaf/hard-of- hearing community. I wanted to highlight people’s current biases and ideologies in a satirical manner.</p><br><br>

		<h2>Brainstorming:</h2> <br>

		<p>This project asked us to use critical design as a medium for critique to challenge ableism and/or inaccessibility. Counter-functional (within critical design) is purposefully removing function aspects of a design to create new opportunities for better design. Its purpose is to make designs more interactive (by limiting their options) to the viewer and foster open discussion. Pierce and Paulos further point out, “…counter functionality bring into focus how omission and opposition can be salient features in one’s use and interaction with a technology. That is, counter function can be a defining aspect of the experience of use, rather than simply a decision in the design process.”</p>

		<p>Linking this to accessibility, I wanted to challenge the charity model still prevalent in societal discourse, specifically with the Deaf/hard-of- hearing community. I wanted to highlight people’s current biases and ideologies in a satirical manner.</p>

		<h2>Ideating:</h2> <br>

		<p>My intial proposal was proposal is a brand package (logo and a banner). This would be framed within the disability charity model in a critical design lens. I would critique it through highlighting people's biases and ideologies of making fun of people with hard of hearing/deaf but flipped. Attached is the aesthetic and wording I would go for (either that or 'dated' 50's aesthetic). I was thinking wording would be through slogan and pull quotes throughout the promotional material. Currently from my sketches, I am drawn the the idea of fragmented typography to visualy show how people hard of hearing typically process conversations and information.</p>

				<p>I purposely made these headphones ‘broken’ to remove the functional aspect that enables you to hear sounds. I wanted to highlight by not being able to hear sounds (within the context of headphones), your world would be silent. You could still see noise happening around you due to people responding to it, but you could hear it. In this instance, someone might feel isolated and segregated from the rest of society.</p>

				<p>The colour palette is 1950’s inspired, referencing the outdated and segregating thinking of the charity model. This type of old-fashion thinking has been an issue for the Deaf and hard of hearing community. The red and green colours are contrasting, and with two different types of font ‘clashing’ , it makes the slogan hard to read – giving people a visual representation of an idea of impact of world of someone with a hearing deficit.</p>

				<p>The slogan “Can you Hear Me?” is in reference to people’s invasive questions to the Deaf/hard-of-hearing community. This slogan envelops the idea that this community becomes defined by their disability, and that is the focal point, rather than them as a person.</p>

				<p>I wanted to highlight the societal segregation between hearing and hard of hearing people by emphasising a common statement with the title and visually with the contrasting fonts, showing the diXiculty of reading it and the dissonance between the two parties.</p>

				<p>The call to action – “Amplify inclusion for people with hard of hearing” was a way to tie in positive awareness to the subject.</p>
