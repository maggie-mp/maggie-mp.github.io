			<h1>Co-Designing the Wairarapa Train Line</h1> <br>
			<br><br> 

			<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 12px;">The Greater Wellington region is a spread-out city with a dense population. Many people live in the suburbs and rely on public transport to get into the city centre. One area that relies on public transport, specifically trains heavier than most, is the Wairarapa region. Many people work in Wellington and use the train services as a result due to distance. With its burgeoning population, the Wairarapa Connection is the primary public transport service to get into the Wellington City Centre that does not involve driving. <br><br>

			The foundation of my co-design process is to foster trust between stakeholders. Using the co-design lens of ‘prioritising relationships’ will foster trust between stakeholders long-term. The objective being that commuter’s concerns have been respected and valued while working alongside professional advice and balancing adequate power . Further iterating and evolving the Wairarapa Connection with co-design principles will lead to a reliable service, an interactive commuter-centric train service co-created by all stakeholders and is appreciated by all communities within the Wairarapa region. </p>

		<!--Background--> 

				<h2>Background of the Wairarapa Train</h2>

				<p>Since the train service is heavily relied upon and covers a geographically large area, the service needs to be flawless. Currently, however, it isn’t reliable. In February, only 5.8% of the Wairarapa train service was within five minutes of its schedule. This is considered ‘unsatisfactory’ (Howell, 2024). This, alongside my personal experience of last-minute cancellations for the evening services, frustration is high among commuters. Even though the Wairarapa public have been vocal and advocated for an upgraded and reliable train service for years with higher frequency, Metlink and Kiwirail have only just worked on maintenance for the last few years: “ ...replacing 40km of rails and sleepers, replacing three bridges, replacing track through the Māoribank tunnel and upgrading level crossings'' (Carry, 2024). The Regional Council agrees that despite being promised better times, they are faced with a service that is not fit for purpose. (Carry, 2024).</p> 
				
				<p>Stakeholders directly affected are Metlink train staff and managers, Metlink as a company, Kiwirail, and the Wairarapa train commuters (students, working adults, families, and elderly). Currently, Metlink has most of the power as they plan and run the overall commuting service and are the ones sourcing Kiwirail for construction. Commuters have the least amount of power.</p>

				<p>Currently, I have noticed that because Metlink has no effective communication with commuter's concerns with the service, commuters have little trust in Metlink that their voices will be heard in the decision-making process. The co-design principles I am focusing on are prioritising relationships and building capability. By prioritising relationships, this will help facilitate connections between stakeholders and therefore, foster trust.</p>

		<!--Co-Design Process-->

				<h2>Co-Design Process:</h2>

				<p>For my Co-Design process, I want to achieve a visual scope of commuters' experiences taking the Wairarapa train through a Co-Design workshop. I have separated Metlink staff and the commuters to encourage participation and mitigate any hostility. The Co-Design workshop will be broken into stages.</p>

		<!--Research and Testing-->

				<h3>Pre-Stage 1: Research and Testing</h3>
				<p>A design team (consisting of three Co-Design facilitators and two researchers) will meet up to debrief the workshop process below. They would look at open spaces that can be flexible in layout to host the workshop. They will also research common body language patterns, mitigating sticky situations, and how they will market the workshop.</p>

				<p>Before opening the workshop to the general public, a small pool of commuters (less than 20 people) will go through a pilot of the entire workshop, including a small survey at the end. This is to test-run the workshop process and will help the design team review if adjustments need to be made. The commuters will be compensated with a $50 voucher for their time.</p>

		<!--Visualise and Notate-->

				<h3>Stage 1: Visualise + Notate:</h3>
				<p>Before the open workshop begins (for the general public), Wairarapa commuters will be asked to take photos before, during, and after the Wairarapa commuting experience. This will include photos of people, common places, and feelings associated with commuting. If participants do not have a smartphone, facilitators will provide cameras. Commuters can also note down challenges, frustrations, and ideas for improvements. They will be given a week to do this before the workshop begins. With the common thread being commuters using the Wairarapa Connection, I will use photo journalling to encourage commuters to feel comfortable about sharing their ideas and stories with others, with the assistance of the individual's photos. This can lead to fostering relatedness between commuters and empathy.</p>

				<p>To encourage power balance, photo journalling will visually show Metlink and Kiwirail the importance of the commuter’s experience of taking the Wairarapa Connection and giving the commuters more power . It will show the realities of going through the train system from the user’s perspective, who and what commuters interact with, and how different the train commuting experience is for individuals.</p>

		<!--Stage 2: Gather + Co-Collage:-->

				<h3>Stage 2: Gather + Co-Collage:</h3>
				<p>After introductions, an icebreaker activity will include commuters identifying what respect and being open to ideas means to them. This establishes a common ground to get commuters talking to each other in a safe space.</p>

				<p>The school children involved in the workshop will be given Legos to explain their ideas to other children. For the adults, they will use the photos collated in the ‘Visual + Notate’ stage and be put into groups of 4-8, sitting in a circle. They will be asked to create a collage (with annotations) of their ‘ideal interaction’ with the Wairarapa Connection. After a quick lunch break, all participants will be given a $20 supermarket voucher for volunteering their time alongside a quick survey to complete.</p>

				<p>For the stakeholder power, this would give more power to Wairarapa commuters as it presents to other stakeholders a unified voice through multiple group collage pieces. The annotations will show their values, what users are thinking in regards to the Wairarapa Connection, and their unmet, underlying needs.</p>


		<!--Stage 3: Review:-->

				<h3>Stage 3: Review:</h3>
				<p>After the workshop, the design team will meet up and discuss the overall workshop with feedback from the participants, and debrief how to refine the process if they were to do it again. If it doesn't go as well as anticipated, they will refine the process accordingly.</p>

				<p>The process of reviewing and evaluating the feedback is an important step to identify key insights that the design team found in the workshop process, bridging background context to the lived experience, refining what’s worth highlighting within the workshop, and stepping back to look at the full picture or the why of doing the entire co-design process. McKercher (2020), also notes the importance of noticing signals, “...is there reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, sustainment?”</p>


		<!--Stage 4:  Rapid Prototyping + Integrate Feedback and Iterate:-->

				<h3>Stage 3: Rapid Prototyping + Integrate Feedback and Iterate:</h3>
				<p>The design team will then collate participants' collages into one document and will present it to a  board of Metlink and Kiwirail representatives about their findings in a roundtable office so the power is balanced between the stakeholders and diagrams/collages. This also means that the information can be seen from anywhere around the table. The team will emphasise the importance of the commuting experience and any other key information collected in the workshops, like underlying themes and ideas needed in their service.</p>

				<p>They will then facilitate a mini-workshop of rapid drawing prototyping while integrating feedback and iteration with Metlink and Kiwirail representatives to convert their construction plans and the commuter’s workshop data into one large timeline/journey map with annotations of how they are going to mitigate commuter’s concerns. Drawing prototypes is a quick, low-entry, low-budget way to generate ideas (Ideo, n.d).</p>

				<p>The aim is to rapidly prototype ideas that bring power back to the Wairarapa commuters and create a dialogue between commuters and professionals through a visual medium that allows room for back-and-forth feedback and refinements for improvements (this could be through open workshops or physical community boards around the Wairarapa region). <br><br> Afterward, the design team will do Stage 3 again.</p>


		<!-- Stage 5: Feedback Loop: -->

		<h3>Stage 5: Feedback Loop:</h3>

				<p>With permission from Metlink, the results from the professional workshop session will be publicly released for commuters to view and add to. These will be shown on physical community boards on each of the platforms on the Wairarapa line and social media channels.</p>

				<p>This will allow commuters to adjust data points and photos, and drop off feedback to the board, which will be passed onto Metlink directly. Then the whole process can be repeated until small progress steps are made. This will hopefully begin to bring trust back between Metlink and commuters so that each stakeholder can listen to and respect each other in a safe space.</p>

				<p>Creating an open editable display board across each Wairarapa train station stop will continue to foster dialogue between the professional stakeholders and the commuters, without being in the same room.</p>

				<p>I am approaching this issue through a co-design workshop approach because I wanted to create a welcoming space for creative collaboration between stakeholders. By exploring a plethora of ideas and thoughts directly from users, facilitators can drive change to stakeholders through voicing the user’s voices. Everyone’s opinion is heard in a three-hour workshop session and its foundation is user-centred (Unboxed, 2023). This helps the stakeholders understand lived experience, and build thick data from the user’s perspective of using the service.</p>

				<p>The foundation of my co-design process is to foster trust between stakeholders. Using the co-design lens of ‘prioritising relationships’ will foster trust between stakeholders long-term. The objective being that commuter’s concerns have been respected and valued while working alongside professional advice and balancing adequate power . Further iterating and evolving the Wairarapa Connection with co-design principles will lead to a reliable service, an interactive commuter-centric train service co-created by all stakeholders and is appreciated by all communities within the Wairarapa region.</p>
