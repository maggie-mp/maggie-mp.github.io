			<h1>Co-Designing the Wairarapa Train Line</h1> <br>
			<br><br> 

			<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 12px;">The Greater Wellington region is a spread-out city with a dense population. Many people live in the suburbs and rely on public transport to get into the city centre. One area that relies on public transport, specifically trains heavier than most, is the Wairarapa region. Many people work in Wellington and use the train services as a result due to distance. With its burgeoning population, the Wairarapa Connection is the primary public transport service to get into the Wellington City Centre that does not involve driving. <br><br>

			The foundation of my co-design process is to foster trust between stakeholders. Using the co-design lens of ‘prioritising relationships’ will foster trust between stakeholders long-term. The objective being that commuter’s concerns have been respected and valued while working alongside professional advice and balancing adequate power . Further iterating and evolving the Wairarapa Connection with co-design principles will lead to a reliable service, an interactive commuter-centric train service co-created by all stakeholders and is appreciated by all communities within the Wairarapa region. </p>

					This website aims to follow WCAG 2.2 AA. I used Venngage and Colour Contrast Checker websites to make sure it met the contrast standard. Usability testing was done after the development of the website with a variety of people, including one tester with disabilities. Sadly, no assistive technology was used during the testing phase. This website was built with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The limitations of this website include: not all images include alternative text, sections are not in plain language, and this website may break on mobile devices. <br>If you have any accessibility issues with this website, please contact me via email: magsmcperry@gmail.com. <br>Thank you!</p>
