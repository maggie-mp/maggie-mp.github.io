			<h2>What if businesses were incentivised to create and champion accessible dining?</h2> 
			<br><br> 

			<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 12px;">My proposal is an app that shows and promotes accessible eateries across Aotearoa. The app will help find nearby, disability-friendly eateries, and clearly show which businesses are performing well/not well through a review and rating system. Making eateries more accessible encourages and supports inclusive social outings with a community-focused drive and commitment to accessibility. This can positively impact individuals’ wellbeing as it broadens dining options for everyone.</p>

		<!--The Problem -->

			<div class="column paragraphs">
				<h2>The Problem & Opportunity:</h2>

				<p>Currently in Aotearoa, Accessibility Policies are 20 years behind those of other developed countries, due to the lack of data used to inform policy development. This gap creates a collective challenge across all sectors of society and does not meet human rights obligations outlined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). Many disabled people still have to contact restaurants and cafes in advance to check if they are accessible. The lack of enforcable regulations of policy implementation, alongside cafes and restaurants having no external incentive (or ‘reward’) for being an accessible space means that accessibility is rarely implemented into building designs themselves and workplace culture (D-List, 2024). Access Bites presents an opportunity to address these issues through Innovative Design, providing a simple communication channel between the disabled community and businesses.</p>

				<p>I am interested in addressing the lack of accessibility for disabled people in dining spaces, such as restaurants and cafes, and investigating the opportunities that surround this issue through a Design Justice approach. Through my own dining experiences, I see an opportunity to co-design a tool, an app, that celebrates restraurants and cafes that champion accessibility in their buildings and workplace culture, through a rating system. As an Interaction and Social Innovation Designer, I see that co-designing alongside the community would foster a culture of inclusion. Design should be able to show the ways in which resturants and cafes, whether knowingly or not, create barriers that exclude disabled people. My app, Access Bites, would highlight the value that accessible spaces bring to the community.</p>

		<!--AIM AND OBJECTIVES-->

		<div class="column paragraphs" style="margin: 100px 0px;">
			<h2>Aims & Objectives: Create an App - Access Bites</h2>
			<br><br>

			<h3 style="margin: 0;">Promote Accessible Eateries & Co-Design with the disabled community to guarantee accurate representation:</h3>

			<p>The Access Bites app will map, review, and rate eateries in Aotearoa based on accessibility features.</p>

				<ul>
     				<li>Create a Star Rating System: <br>
     				The star ratings would be caculated based on reviews left by disabled people. This makes it easy to identify those eateries which are considered accessibility friendly or not.</li>
     				<br>

     				<li>Highlight Disabled Communities Voices: <br>
     				Anyone can leave a review about their experiences. Tags would be avalible to easily identify whether the eatery caters to certain disabilities or not.</li>
     			</ul>

     			<h3 style="margin-top: 250px; margin-left: 0;">Incentivise Businesses to make Change & Raise Awareness about Accessibility in Eateries and its importance:</h3>

			<p>The Access Bites app will create a communication channel between the disabled community and businesses.</p>

				<ul>
     				<li>Drive awareness for meaningful change:<br>
     				Integrating the rating system will clearly show businesses where they are ranked in regards to customer accessibility. This might motivate businesses to change how they are run and create a net positive for their business image.</li>
     				<br>

     				<li>Show the positive impact of Accessible Design: <br>
     				Business having a high accessibility star rating can attact a broder customer base, leading to increased revenue.</li>
     			</ul>

		<h2>Precedents:</h2> <br>
		<h3 style="margin: 0;">Contento:</h3>

		<p>Contento was a restaurant in New York City which was open from 2021 - 2024. It began with two wheelchair users, Yannick Benjamin and George Gallego who wanted to create a restaurant by disabled people, for disabled people. The restaurant owners prioritised accessibility for disabled customers and designed the restaurant accordingly. Some of the designs restaurant’s features included:</p>

			<ul>
     				<li>“Tables are spaced around the edge of the restaurant, and wheelchair users have enough space to fit at every table without staff having to move things around.</li>

     				<li>All tables are set at a height that can accommodate most manual and power wheelchair users.</li>

     				<li>The bar is split evenly, with one section at typical height and the other set low.</li>

     				<li>The outdoor seating is level and as roomy as the inside.</li>

     				<li>There is one bathroom, and it has enough space for a power wheelchair user to turn around and recline if necessary.</li>

     				<li>The bar is split evenly, with one section at typical height and the other set low.</li>

     				<li>A server will bring you adaptive utensils if you request them.</li>

     				<li>Menus are available in braille or via QR code and a screen reader if you need“ (McBride, 2022).</li>
     		</ul>

     		<br>

				</div>

				<div class="column img">
				<br>
	  				<p>They were known for their attention to detail in regards to the way they accomodated customers with various disabilities and for adapting their staff culture and overall etiquette based on customer feedback. <br> I chose Contento as a precedent as it shows what an accessibile eatery can look like when accessibility is considered in the design of a resturant space. It clearly outlines the criteria of what makes a successful, accessible, and inclusive eatery.</p>
				</div>
		</div>


		<h3 style="margin: 0; margin-top:50px;">Resy:</h3>

		<p>Resy is an app that helps users to book reservations at restaurants. It clearly shows what eateries in your area, (within the USA), and users can quickly access information about the place. The app features categories for different cuisines, star ratings, and price points. I chose this is as a precedent because it offers a streamlined process of quickly finding information about restaurants. It removes the issue of having to visit multiple eatery websites to find information. It has a clean and simple interface which I want to emulate. Resy also allows users to create lists of their favourite restaurants to share with friends on the app. This makes it easier to organise social catchups with friends, and share information.</p>

     	<h2 style="margin: 0; margin-top:100px;">Laws in Aotearoa:</h2>

		<p>Aotearoa has Accessibility Standards built into its building protocols. The Building Accessibility standards were created in 2001 and only apply to new builds, post-2001. This means many historical buildings that have been converted into cafes and restaurants do not meet the accessibility standards and therefore, there is a significant gap between accessibility policies and their implementation in public dining spaces. <br><br>

		There is currently no entity responsible for regulating whether buildings comply with Accessibility Standards. This means many businesses think it is not important to create accessible spaces as there is no one checking or enforcing this. Resturant owners also think it is difficult to create accessible spaces and therefore they put it in the ‘too hard basket’. <br><br>

		From the Spinoff article by Banks called “Some of us have always been excluded from dining out” it states, “...it is a choice that parts of society made to not make their doorway, their information, their consumer offering, their employment policy inclusive for you” (Banks, 2021). <br><br>

		The lack of regulations of policy implementation, alongside cafes and restaurants having no external incentive (or ‘reward’) to have accessible spaces means that the possibility of accessibility being intergrated into the buildings and embedded into the workplace culture is very low.</p>
